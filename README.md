# SteamGameRecommenderSystem
The goal of the Steam Game Recommender System is to predict the playtime of users for different games based on their historical playtime data. The system leverages a collaborative filtering approach using matrix factorization with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and incorporates user and game biases to enhance prediction accuracy.
